# Shift Sync
Shift Sync is a tool that automates syncing work shifts from official scheduling websites into your preferred calendar or app, making schedules easier to access, filter, and manage.
Many hospitals and clinics publish monthly shift schedules in a table format online, but these can be hard to read and filter. This tool makes schedules easier to access, filter, and sync with tools like Google Calendar.
